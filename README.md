This repository is dedicated to MD Rashadul Islam's undergraduate thesis Data collection and analysis project. The total data Collection, cleaning, and analysis are done by a software program called Stata 17 Version.

In this thesis I have collected 135 variables and observed 172180 values where I separated all the variables according to income level status of every country. Then I found 4 different income level ; High , Low , Upper middle and Lower middle income. Then I have merged High and upper middle income data. Also low and lower middle income data. After a long cleaning process , I found 18 main variables.From two income data set, "High and upper middle income" and "low and lower middle income"  I finalized  744 and 253 observation respectively.
